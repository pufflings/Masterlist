    <p>You keep your pace quick, rushing to the castle as Aria's words echo in your head: <i>Urgent!!!</i> Struggling to keep up, your Puffling clings to your coat for dear life, yet you keep moving. Whatever awaits you at Puff Castle must be serious.
Yet, as you cross the last hill, you can't stop yourself from gawking.
Puff Castle rises from the valley floor, its walls glittering like stained glass. At the peak, a massive magical ring spins slowly, pulsing with power.</p>

<div class="dialogue-simple">
    <p>The castle only grows bigger as you get closer. The staircase rises higher than the walls of any town you've seen. The doors look heavy enough to take a dozen Pufflings just to budge them. Even the steps are wide and flat, built for strides much longer than yours.
Your Puffling clings to your shoulder, catching their breath. The castle towers over both of you, and the other puff sized buildings around you look even smaller in comparison.
As you approach the gates, the guard stationed at the entrance widens his eyes at the sight of your guild emblem and rushes to welcome you.</p>

    <p>You stare up. The doorway is so tall you could stack ten Puffs on top of each other and still not reach the top. Before you can even reply, the Guard quickly ushers you into the castle.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-simple">
    <p>As soon as you step inside, before you can even register your surroundings, a loud <i>CRASH!</i> startles you. A door next to you opens, and two pufflings barrel down the hallway at full speed, one chasing the other. You yank yourself and your Puffling out of the way just in time as they blast past.
The first Puff skids to a stop, eyes wide when she spots you. The second puff, panting and struggling to keep up, looks at you with pleading eyes.</p>

    <p>She rushes past you, Pebble following her, out of the castle, leaving you completely baffled. The guard, seemingly used to this, just shrugs and leads you to the throne room.</p>

<div class="dialogue-simple">
    <p>The throne room glitters like the inside of a jewel. At the far end, a throne much too large for its occupants, shakes with every bounce of King Puff. His little crown wobbles as he paces in frantic circles. Next to him, Queen Puff sits on a cushion, teacup balanced neatly in her paws. She takes a sip, unbothered, eyes half-lidded with a gentle smile.</p>

    <p><p>The castle stands at the heart of the <strong>Puff Kingdom</strong>, surrounded by towering magical crystals that rise like mountains.<br>

All around, Puffs of every size bustle about cheerfully — of course they do. This is, after all, their capital.</p>

<p>At last… you arrive.</p>

<p>The enormous castle rises from the valley, its walls shimmering like stained glass in the sunlight. Above its tallest tower, a massive magic circle turns slowly, radiating a gentle glow as if it were the <i>heart of all magic in the kingdom.</i></p>

<p>The castle only grows bigger as you get closer, until you’re forced to crane your neck just to see the top. Even the steps are wide and flat, built for strides much longer than yours. You climb up panting with effort</p>

<p>while the Puffs, of course, simply flutter upward with ease.</p>

<p>Two castle guards spot the guild insignia on your coat. Their eyes widen, and they hurry to greet you.</p></p>

    <p>You keep your pace quick, rushing to the castle as Aria's words echo in your head: <i>Urgent!!!</i> Struggling to keep up, your Puffling clings to your coat for dear life, yet you keep moving. Whatever awaits you at Puff Castle must be serious.
Yet, as you cross the last hill, you can't stop yourself from gawking.
Puff Castle rises from the valley floor, its walls glittering like stained glass. At the peak, a massive magical ring spins slowly, pulsing with power.</p>

Your Puffling clings to your shoulder, catching their breath. The castle towers over both of you, and the other puff sized buildings around you look even smaller in comparison.
As you approach the gates, the guard stationed at the entrance widens his eyes at the sight of your guild emblem and rushes to welcome you.</p>

    <p>As soon as you step inside, before you can even register your surroundings, a loud <i>CRASH!</i> startles you. A door next to you opens, and two pufflings barrel down the hallway at full speed, one chasing the other. You yank yourself and your Puffling out of the way just in time as they blast past.
The first Puff skids to a stop, eyes wide when she spots you. The second puff, panting and struggling to keep up, looks at you with pleading eyes.</p>

    <p>After the noise of the castle, Puff Town feels almost too calm, even as it hums with life. The crystal houses glow softly in the sun, and Puffs shuffle by with smiles and snacks. There are almost no Seekers around, with all stores and stalls being Puffling sized. The local Puffs greet you warmly, their cheerful chatter echoing like the laughter of carefree children. The scent of delicious food wafts through the air. Everyone looks so happy here.</p>
