Dialogue:
[narration] As time passes and you start to worry about the princess, Pebble tugs your sleeve and guides you up a narrow trail along the hill. It is not far from the castle, hardly a secret at all. Yet when Pebble insists on bringing you here, you follow. At the top, you see her.
Princess Peridot sits alone, her back turned, ears swaying in the wind. You reach out a hand - then freeze. The view steals your breath.
The air shimmers with drifting pollen, glowing like small crystals. A faint wiff of magic stirs with the breeze. Below, the valley burns with color. Puff Castle rises against the horizon, its jeweled towers burning with the last light of day. Gold and violet shadows spill across the valley, like a dream painted in light. For a moment, even your thoughts fall silent.

[Princess Peridot | Peridot | ] Come sit with me. Thanks for keeping Pebble company, by the way.


[narration] She looks so calm and serene you wouldn't have known she was the same princess you met earlier. You sit down beside her, while Pebble stays a few feet away, watching over her.


[Princess Peridot | Peridot | ] Funny, isn't it? I ran away from that place... and here I am, staring at it.


[You | You | right] That castle... it is beautiful.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] I like looking at it too. It makes you feel small, but also... wondering?


[Pebble | Pebble | ] They say it wasn't built by Puffs. Just look at the size of it! Those doors, the stairs. Even a Seeker like you is too small for it.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] It's been there for generations. Even the oldest Pufflings can't remember a time without it. They tell stories of their grandparents saying the same thing, as if the castle was already ancient back then. And maybe that's why pufflings started making up stories. To explain what doesn't have an answer.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] One of my favorite stories was about where Pufflings came from. The knight's captain used to tell it when I couldn't sleep. She'd say we were descended from dragons: great, wise, fire-breathing beasts that ruled the world long ago. For them, a castle like that wouldn't have seemed so large.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] Some nights she would tell me the fire still sleeps in our hearts, waiting for the right Puffling to unlock it. The other knights laughed at me for clinging to a child's tale, but I never minded. It gave me something to reach for.


[You | You | right] Who knows... The legends of dragons carried us Seekers across the world. And it led us here.


[Princess Peridot | Peridot | ] But all you found were weak, little Pufflings...


[You | You | right] It's true that at first many of us were disappointed. But little by little, that changed. You laughed with us, trained beside us, stumbled and stood again. And in those moments, we realized...that the dream isn't over yet. The path ahead is long, but we'll walk it together.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] That is why I like Seekers. You're brave and you never give up.


[narration] Pebble unsheathes his sword, and raises it high.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] That's why I won't give up either! One day... I'll grow stronger and unlock the fire burning inside me! I'll be even stronger than a dragon! So I can protect Princess Peridot!


[Princess Peridot | Peridot | ] Oh come on, Pebble~ Stop saying embarrassing things!


[narration] The three of you laugh, watching the ring above the castle turn. No more words are needed, but in your hearts, you're already looking far beyond towards a world full of dreams, of questions and answers waiting to be found.


[narration] By the time you return, the sun is setting. Light gathers on the towers as if guiding the princess home.


[King Puff | King | ] Hmph! About time you got back! It is nearly nightfall, and those guards still have not closed the gates!


[King Puff | King | ] Hmph, here. You must be hungry after wandering all day. What a coincidence! We just happened to have pudding. I definitely did not ask the chef to make it.


[Princess Peridot | Peridot | ] I am not upset about that anymore. That pudding was spoiled anyway. Serves you right for eating it - bleh!


[King Puff | King | ] You little - ugh! My stomach started hurting the moment you said that...


[narration] Peridot laughs, bright and unguarded. Pebbles shoulders relax. The Queen motions for you to get closer.


[Queen Puff | Queen | right] It is not much... but please accept this.


[narration] Inside the pouch lie colorful crystals that smell faintly sweet.


[Queen Puff | Queen | right] They are candies. I made them myself.


[narration] The shimmer of their colors almost made you mistake them for gemstones... Yet these candies radiate a quiet warmth. A small gift, yes, but overflowing with kindness.


[narration] Before leaving the castle, you say your farewells.


[Pebble | Pebble | ] Thanks for today, Seeker. Besides Pebble, you are the only one who listened to my dream. Next time, you tell me yours.


[You | You | right] Sure, let's talk again next time. Without needing to sneak out of the castle.


[narration] Their laughter follows you down the road.


[narration] Night has fallen by the time you return to the Guild Hall. A tall man in a white cloak sits where Aria should be. He looks calm and serious, but not scary, his eyes having the playfulness of a child. A Puff sleeps on his head, rising and falling with each breath.


[Guild Master | Guild Master | hidden] Oh! You are the new recruit. Welcome! Welcome! I hope Aria treated you well. Hmm? Already finished a mission?


[narration] He stands up and shakes your hand vigorously. You tell him everything that happened. He listens, chuckling.


[Guild Master | Guild Master | hidden] So she tricked you, uh? I never said anything about starting your first mission. That rascal… but missions from Puff Castle are usually trivial, so I'm glad it worked out fine.


[Guild Master | Guild Master | hidden] It's just an old agreement between the guild and the Puff Kingdom. We attend to the king's whims and in exchange we get to use this building. Think of it as paying rent.


[narration] The Guild Master falls silent for a moment, as if hesitating, before continuing.


[Guild Master | Guild Master | hidden] About Aria... Don't be too hard on her, will you? She lost her Puff partner recently. She probably hasn't had the heart to do much since. If paperwork keeps her busy, that's good enough.


[Guild Master | Guild Master | hidden] As for you: how about a <i>real</i> mission? I know it's sudden, but I'm sure you'll do just fine. You're a full fledged Seeker now, so you're ready for the real deal! Go back to your room and rest well. We leave at sunrise~


[narration] He slaps you in the back and laughs. You try to protest, but the Guild Master is already walking out. You sigh in resignation. You step out, saying goodnight to the other guild members around and to the guild Puffs that helped you. Your thoughts drift to Aria. There was something in her eyes... a determination to keep moving forward. She didn't seem resigned like the Guild Master seemed to believe. Someday, you'll speak with her again.


[narration] The night is chilly, but you decide to stop by Poki's stall before making your way back to your room.


[You | You | right] Hey, glad I caught you still open. Thanks for everything earlier. My first "mission" was a success, I think. Apparently missions from the Puff Castle don't really count? But I'm a Seeker now, so... yeah.


[You | You | right] Anyways, I was wondering if I could trade something.


[Poki | Poki | ] What?! Trying to scam me with candy?! Do you take me for a fool, huh?!


[Momo | Momo | right] Meow~


[narration] You smile awkwardly, and explain that you received the candy from the Queen... and you want to trade it for something: a gift for Aria.


[You | You | right] This is all I've got from my first mission. Please, Poki. Please, help me out.


[narration] Poki's expression softens. She seems to understand right away.


[Poki | Poki | ] …Heh. Aria the Lone Flame, huh? That is worth more than enough. Here—your change. You overpaid.


[narration] She packs a small gift into a pouch, taking only one piece of candy from your hand.


[Poki | Poki | ] Here, your change. You overpaid.


[You | You | right] Thank you, Poki!


[narration] You run off, grinning from ear to ear.


[Momo | Momo | right] Meow~


[Poki | Poki | ] What? Soft-hearted, me? What are you saying, Momo? You really don't get it, uh? That's candy from <i>the Queen</i>. It's packed with magic. Worth ten times what you think! Anyone who eats it would be a total fool! He he he~


[narration] Momo sighs a long, bored sigh.


[narration] That night, you fall asleep in a small guest room at the guild. A breeze slips through the window, carrying the soft, crystal-sweet scent of dark. A tiny post-Puff enthusiastically takes the gift package from your windowsill, bound for Aria.
<br>
<i>If you have a Puff partner:</i>: Your Puff partner is curled up beside you, breathing gently. Its soft presence brings peace to the room.
<br>
You close your eyes and think of Pebble's oath, Peridot's smile, and Aria's determination. Tomorrow you leave the capital to walk the true path of a Seeker.


[image] https://img-l.ink/img/1jD4K3JNJPo5zAJZa-_ercCfu9kBD3eZk.png


[narration] Tomorrow morning— you'll leave the capital behind. To explore a world still untouched. To walk the true path of a Seeker.
