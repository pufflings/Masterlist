Dialogue:
[narration] You wave Poki and Momo good-bye, then push open the heavy doors of the Guild Hall, expecting the lively buzz of bustling guild. Instead... silence. The front desk is empty. Someone who looks like a staff member rushes past you, too busy to notice you. Even when you call out, no one stops.

[You | You | right] This... isn't the kind of guild I imagined at all...


[narration] Your eyes sweep the walls until you spot a large wooden door at the back, stamped with the guild's crest. That must be important. You hesitate, then raise a hand and knock softly.


[Aria | ??? | hidden] You can come in.


[narration] The calm voice drifts through the heavy wood. You push the door open and step inside.
The office is grand - bookshelves line the walls, papers neatly stacked... except for one messy pile sitting on the desk. A young woman sits behind it, pale pink hair falling neatly around her sharp, steady eyes. She looks at you for second before returning her attention to the papers.


[Aria | Aria | ] You're a new recruit, right? My name is Aria. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry I can't greet you properly, work just keeps piling up.


[narration] She motions at the pile of papers on her desk as if it wasn't obvious. She sighs dramatically.


[Aria | Aria | ] I guess... It's time for a break, anyway.


[You | You | right] Are you the guildmaster?


[Aria | Aria | ] No. I'm a High Rank Seeker. The guildmaster's out on urgent business, so I'm filling in for now.


[narration] She glances back at the pile of papers on her desk and stands up, stretching her back.


[Aria | Aria | ] Probably no one outside greeted you, right? And instead of waiting for someone to help you, you decided to interrupt my work.


[narration] Her tone isn't angry. if anything, there's a faint clue of amusement in her tone, and the slight smile on her face implies she enjoys watching you squirm.


[Aria | Aria | ] Let's begin properly. Who are you, where did you come from, and why did you join this guild? No need to sound impressive. Just be honest.


[narration] She slides a form across the desk, placing a quill on top. You fill in the form as best you can.


[Aria | Aria | ] Hm... I see. Looks good enough to me.


[narration] She digs through the pile of papers on her desk and pulls out a letter.


[Aria | Aria | ] I have just the mission for you.


[You | You | right] Wait, what? What about the test? I'm not ready for this yet!


[Aria | Aria | ] We're short on people, so let's skip the usual formalities. Besides, your Keystone shows enough. You found it, decorated it, made it yours. That's proof enough for me.


[narration] Her steady gaze makes you relax. For a moment, you smile without realizing it. You'll have to thank Poki and Momo for this.


[Aria | Aria | ] Puff Castle sent an urgent letter, signed by King Puff himself. Lots of 'Urgent!!!' scribbled in the margins and not much else. We don't know the exact details, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.


[You | You | right] But it's a letter from King Puff himself, isn't it? That sounds... really serious.


[Aria | Aria | ] I'm sure you'll do just fine~ Puff Castle is that huge crystal on the horizon. The glowing one with the magic ring spinning on top. You can't miss it.


[Aria | Aria | ] Do you have a Puffling partner? If not, don't worry. The guild has a few Pufflings on retainer for emergencies like this.


[Aria | Aria | ] Of course, they won't be permanent. Borrowed Pufflings return to the guild after the job's done. But for now, they'll make sure you're not walking into Puff Castle completely alone.


[You | You | right] I see… so every Seeker needs a Puff with them?


[Aria | Aria | ] That's the rule. Seekers and Puffs are paired for every mission. Pufflings can use magic, but are weak. Seekers are strong, but can't use magic. They complement each other quite well, wouldn't you say?


[narration] Her explanation is calm, but there's a brief pause in her voice. Her eyes lower to the desk before meeting yours again.


[You | You | right] What about you, Aria? Don't you have a Puff partner?


[Aria | Aria | ] ...Not anymore. That's why I can't go on missions. Paperwork is all I've got now. Which means you'd better succeed, because if King Puff gets angry, I'm the one who gets yelled at. Now go! Let's not keep the king waiting.


[narration] Aria watches silently as you step out of the office. When the door closes, she exhales wistfully.


[Aria | Aria | ] Reminds me of when I first joined...<br><i>If only you were still here with me.</i>
