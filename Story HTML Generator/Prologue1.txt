Dialogue:
[narration] <p>A new recruit stood before the grand entrance of the guild’s <i>Central hall</i>, looking a little lost.</p>
<p>They stepped inside and found themselves on the <i>circular walkway</i> that wrapped around the <i>Main Hall.</i></p>


[You | You | right] <i>Wow… the Central Guild really is huge. It’s nothing compared to the outside…</i>


[narration] <p>It had been over forty years since the Seekers first discovered the Puff Kingdom and encountered the wondrous creatures known as Pufflings.
<br>Here, in this land of magic and mystery, Seekers from all corners of the world had gathered.</p>


<p> Together, they built the great central guild known as “The Hatchery” a place where the legend of dragons lives on, and where every aspiring dreamer begin their very own adventure here. </p>


<p>You walked along the circular walkway and stopped before the inner doors of the Main Hall, clutching your belongings as if to summon your courage.</p>


<p>You took a deep breath, smiled to yourself, and whispered—</p>


[You | You | right] Alright… once I step through here, my journey will <i>really</i>
begins.


[narration] <p><i>Ring-ding~!</i></p>


<p>A soft ringing sound came from behind her, followed by a cheerful voice echoing from a small shop tucked in one corner of the hall.</p>


[Poki | ??? | hidden] Hmm~? Oh who’s this?


[Poki | ??? | hidden] Don’t think I’ve seen your face before~ You must be a <i>newbie</i>, huh?”

[narration] <p>A small white-haired lady in a tall hat sat behind the counter of a small shop, tucked along the circular walkway. The place was bathed in the warm glow of sunlight streaming through the windows, and all around her were shelves lined with glass jars, glittering crystals, and all sorts of curious trinkets.</p>

<p>A warm smile curved across her face behind a pair of round glasses. </p>


[Poki | Poki | ] Come here, let me take a look at you…


[narration] She waved a hand playfully toward the newcomer’s outfit.


[Poki | Poki | ] Reporting in, are we?<br>
Don’t tell me you’re planning to meet the Guild Master in that outfit, are you?


[narration] She chuckled teasingly.


[Poki | Poki | ] Well, Welcome, welcome~! You’ve just stepped into <strong>Poki’s Shop</strong> — the finest supply store for Seekers in all of Puff Kingdom! Managed and maintained by yours truly, <strong>Poki Bloodfallen!</strong>


[narration] She smacked the counter <i>— <strong>bang!</strong> — </i> causing the jars behind her to rattle and chime. A fluffy, round, catlike being resting nearby jolted awake with a high-pitched  <i>“Fwoo~!,”</i> before curling back up lazily. Seeing that Poki laughed lightly.


[Poki | Poki | ] Ah—this little one’s Momo, my partner~


[narration] Momo lifted her head and let out a soft sound.


[Momo | Momo | ] Meow~.


[narration] almost indistinguishable from a real cat’s voice. 


[Poki | Poki | ] What’s that, Momo? <br>
I'm <i>not</i> trying to scam them this time! Really! Ahem


[narration] Poki coughed into her hand, giggling before leaning casually on the counter again with an amused grin.


[Poki | Poki | ] So… have you ever met one of them before? I mean, a <strong><i>Puffling.</i></strong>


[narration] Her eyes sparkled as she spoke.


[Poki | Poki | ] They’re soft, fluffy, and super friendly with Seekers, you know~


[Momo | Momo | ] Meow~!!!

[narration] Momo gave a faint cry of protest.

[Poki | Poki | ] Alright, alright… and they’ve got some pretty amazing <strong>magic</strong> too~


[Poki | Poki | ] Of course~ This is their homeland, after all. The Pufflings’ magic even helps with Seeker work, it’s incredible, really!

[narration] Poki picked up a small pamphlet from the counter and handed it over.


[Poki | Poki | ] If you haven’t met one yet, take a look at this — <i><a target="_blank" href="https://toyhou.se/~world/176769.puff-dragon/page/162785.welcome-and-intro-guide">A Quick Beginner’s Guide</a> by Poki! </i>

[Poki | Poki | ] Alright then… let’s get down to business, shall we~? <br>
Meeting the Guild Master for the first time must be nerve-wracking, huh? <br>
But don’t you worry! Poki’s got you covered ♪

[Poki | Poki | ]  “First things first, let’s see your <strong>Keystone</strong> , hmm? <br>
If you’ve made it this far, you surely have one… <br>
but have you ever customized it to make it truly yours?”

[Poki | Poki | ] And next… turn around, let me get a look at your outfit~

[Poki | Poki | ] Good grief! Even Momo after falling down the chimney looked less of a mess than you! <br>

But lucky for you, my shop’s got brand-new outfits in <i>every</i> size~ Heehee!

[narration] She spoke so fast it made your head spin, then she let out a small laugh before flipping open a tiny notebook, scanning through its pages thoughtfully.

[Poki | Poki | ]  Now, one more important thing… Do you already have a <strong>Puff</strong> partner?<br>

If you do, that’s wonderful! It means you’re all set and ready to go~

[narration] Poki’s smile grew warmer, her expression softened.

[Poki | Poki | ] <p>But if you don’t, that’s perfectly fine too. Take your time choosing—there’s no rush. <br>

Just remember… taking on missions without a Puff by your side can be a bit <i>dangerous.</i> </p>

<p>That’s why the guild provides temporary partners for trial Seekers~ You won’t be on your own. </p>

[narration] She leaned against the counter, a subtle hint of seriousness flickering in her eyes.

[Poki | Poki | ] Just keep this in mind… whether you call it fate or a twist of karma, the Puff you bond with will stay by your side for a very long time~

[narration] Then, in the blink of an eye, her bright grin returned as she extended her hand energetically.

[Poki | Poki | ] Now then—strike a pose for me, would you? Let’s see if you’re ready for your big debut~ <br>

I’ll even give you a score myself!

[narration] You showed off your outfit proudly, standing tall before her. Poki crossed her arms, eyeing you up and down with a teasing smirk.

[Poki | Poki | ] Well, what can I say? Either anything looks good on you… or my shop’s outfits are <i>just that</i> good~

[Poki | Poki | ] Alright! Our newbie’s all set to head out, huh~ <br>
Normally, I’d charge for this kind of prep work… but today’s a <i>special promotion!</i> free of charge, courtesy of Poki's Shop~♪
[narration] She laughed softly and gave a playful thumbs-up.
[Poki | Poki | ] Good luck out there~ <br>
If you ever run short on supplies or want something extra special, you know where to find me~ 
<br>At Poki’s Shop, of course—where we’ve got everything from stars above to destiny sealed in a bottle!~★
[Momo | Momo | ] Meow~
[narration] <i>Momo tilted her head, letting out a soft sound, whispering something only Poki can hear.</i>
[Poki | Poki | ] Hm? What’s that, Momo? 
<br><small>You think this newbie’s got potential, huh?</small>
[narration] Poki chuckles, then glances back one more time.
[Poki | Poki | ] <small>Shhh~ Keep it down, or they’ll get a big head~</small>
[narration] She giggled, then turned back with her usual bright smile.
[Poki | Poki | ] Just kidding! <strong>Welcome to the Puff Kingdom!</strong>

Quest:
Quest: Design your keystone
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Draw your own keystone</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br>
<p>Hidden behind a great Illusion Barrier, Puff Kingdom lies beyond the world’s awareness. A powerful magic that hides it from sight and bars all entry.</p>

<p>Only those who carry a Keystone — a crystal with the same magic as the Kingdom — can cross the Barrier and step into its realm.</p>

<p>For those who dream of becoming a Seeker, the first step is to find one such crystal by any means and use it as their Keystone to reach Puff Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Your Keystone</strong> is one of a kind.
You can <strong>design its color, shape, and details however you like</strong> — just be sure it’s clearly visible on your Seeker and feels like a part of you.</p>
<p>Customizing your <strong>Keystone</strong> reflects who <i>you</i> are.<br> 
The more personal the design, the stronger your <strong>Seeker</strong> becomes.
More info about Keystone and Seeker <a target="_blank" href="https://toyhou.se/~world/176769.puff-dragon/page/126972.seeker-info-rules">Click</a></i></p>

<p><i><strong>Optional:</strong> Draw your Seeker in their travel outfit. </p>
</p>The outer Coat can be custom-designed, but it must be white and bear the guild's emblem on the arm. The keystone must be visible in the seeker. You can read more about the Seekers, their outfit and their keystone in the <a target="_blank" href="https://toyhou.se/~world/176769.puff-dragon/page/167397.seeker">Seeker Info / rules</a></i></p>
