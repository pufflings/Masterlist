              <p>As time passes and you start to worry about the princess, Pebble tugs your sleeve and guides you up a narrow trail along the hill. It is not far from the castle, hardly a secret at all. Yet when Pebble insists on bringing you here, you follow. At the top, you see her.</p>
                <p>Princess Peridot sits alone, her back turned, ears swaying in the wind. You reach out a hand - then freeze. The view steals your breath.</p>
              <p>The air shimmers with drifting pollen, glowing like small crystals. A faint wiff of magic stirs with the breeze. Below, the valley burns with color. Puff Castle rises against the horizon, its jeweled towers burning with the last light of day. Gold and violet shadows spill across the valey, like a dream painted in light. For a moment, even your thoughts fall silent.</p>

                            <p>It's been there for generations. Even the oldest Pufflings can't remember a time without it. They tell stories of their grandparents saying the same thing, as if the castle was already ancient back then. And maybe that's why pufflings started making up stories. To explain what doesn't have an answer. </p>

                            <p>One of my favorite stories was about where Pufflings came from. The knight's captain used to tell it when I couldn't sleep. She'd say we were descended from dragons: great, wise, fire-breathing beasts that ruled the world long ago. For them, a castle like that wouldn't have seemed so large. </p>
